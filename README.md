# memoryCapture

This project aims to enhance anomaly detection in user behavior analysis by integrating a novel
"memory fingerprinting" technique. Memory fingerprinting involves capturing and analyzing the
unique memory-related behavior patterns of users to identify anomalies.
By incorporating this approach, we expect to significantly improve the detection capabilities and
gain deeper insights into user behavior patterns. We will use advances machine learning
algorithms and models to adapt and specify detection to individual user characteristics. The
project will utilize cutting-edge machine learning techniques to tailor anomaly detection to the
somewhat unique characteristics of individual users, enhancing our ability to discern and analyze
unique user behavior patterns.
